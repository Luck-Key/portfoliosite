      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        My experience learning web programming has been both enjoyable and
        difficult. I knew very nothing about design, code, or the complexities
        of web development before I began this lesson. I've learned to value the
        subtleties and great joy that come from watching a thing come to
        fruition over time.

      <h2>Developing Fundamental Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        Learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS seemed intimidating at first.
        The properties, tags, and syntax were all quite confusing. But after a
        lot of effort and instruction from tutorials, I started to grasp the
        layout and design of web pages. The turning point came when I was able
        to construct a straightforward homepage with a tidy design.
      </p>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        The process of creating the user interface was both thrilling and
        challenging. I took my time selecting the appropriate typefaces and
        color scheme. I was influenced by the simple for my site's aesthetic.
        Because of its legibility and simple design, I went with a sans-serif
        typeface. In order to provide a positive user experience, the color
        palette was chosen using the principles of color theory.
      </p>
      <h2>Debugging and Coding</h2>
      <p>
        Coding was quite an experience. My problems would frequently take hours
        to troubleshoot. But every problem that was overcome provided a chance
        to learn. I discovered how crucial it was to validate my code, which
        enabled me to find mistakes early on. Utilizing resources such as the
        W3C Markup Validation Service helped me make sure my HTML and CSS were
        up to par. Below are screenshots of my validation reports: ![HTML
